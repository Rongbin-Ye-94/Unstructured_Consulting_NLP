# Unstructured_Consulting_NLP
This repository stores the documents of Robin Ye for comparing Twitter data from multiple consulting firms over time by NLP analysis in python. 

# Executive Summary
This program is for academic usage of Rongbin Ye, a MSBA candidate at University of Notre Dame for Unstructured Data Analysis. I want to compare the tweets from major consulting firms for Natural Language Analysis, such as sentimental analysis, term frequency and topic modeling. Three main deliverables will be: 
1. An interactive visualization showing the frequency and word across the time in different firms. 
2. A group of visualization showing the word network based on the N-gram analysis. 
3. A Topic modeling analysis will be conducted and presented in a visualization. 
This will help my professor, peers and myself to cultivate a better understand of consulting industries and the preference of language usages in different firms.
